          Description:	This is a dumb terminal emulator written in C
          using the Win32 API. It allows for sending and receiving 
          data (characters) over a serial port.
          A user may connect to a specified port with 
          configured settings and begin to send and 
          receive characters.

          The source code and versioning history can be found via 
          the above URL. Please take a look around, feel free to 
          relive the headaches I have endured this past week :P
